A definition of computer security
Computer security: The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources (includes hardware, software, firmware, information/data, and telecommunications)
NIST  1995


--- Slide 5 ---
Three key objectives (the CIA triad)
Confidentiality
Data confidentiality: Assures that confidential information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals
Privacy: Assures that individual control or influence what information may be collected and stored
Integrity
Data integrity: assures that information and programs are changed only in a specified and authorized manner
System integrity: Assures that a system performs its operations in unimpaired manner
Availability: assure that systems works promptly and service is not denied to authorized users


--- Slide 6 ---
Key Security Concepts


--- Slide 7 ---
Other concepts to a complete security picture
Authenticity: the property of being genuine and being able to be verified and trusted; confident in the validity of a transmission, or a message, or its originator
Accountability (Non-Repudiation): generates the requirement for actions of an entity to be traced uniquely to that individual to support nonrepudiation, deference, fault isolation, etc



--- Slide 8 ---
Levels of security breach impact
Low: the loss will have a limited impact, e.g., a degradation in mission or minor damage or minor financial loss or minor harm
Moderate: the loss has a serious effect, e.g., significance degradation on mission or significant harm to individuals but no loss of life or threatening injuries
High: the loss has severe or catastrophic adverse effect on operations, organizational assets or on individuals (e.g., loss of life)


--- Slide 9 ---
Challenges of computer security
Computer security is not simple
One must consider potential (unexpected) attacks
Procedures used are often counter-intuitive
Must decide where to deploy mechanisms
Involve algorithms and secret info (keys)
A battle of wits between attacker / admin
It is not perceived on benefit until fails
Requires constant monitoring
Too often an after-thought (not integral)
Regarded as impediment to using system

Threat consequences
Unauthorized disclosure: threat to confidentiality 
Exposure (release data), interception, inference, intrusion
Deception: threat to integrity
Masquerade, falsification (alter data), repudiation
Disruption: threat to integrity and availability
Incapacitation (destruction), corruption (backdoor logic), obstruction (infer with communication, overload a line)
Usurpation: threat to integrity
Misappropriation (theft of service), misuse (hacker gaining unauthorized access)

Examples of threats


--- Slide 15 ---
Security functional requirements (FIPS 200)
Technical measures
Access control; identification & authentication; system & communication protection; system & information integrity
Management controls and procedures 
Awareness & training; audit & accountability; certification, accreditation, & security assessments; contingency planning; maintenance; physical & environmental protection; planning; personnel security; risk assessment; systems & services acquisition
Overlapping technical and management
Configuration management; incident response; media protection


--- Slide 16 ---
Fundamental security design principles [1/4]
Despite years of research, it is still difficult to design systems that comprehensively prevent security flaws
But good practices for good design have been documented (analogous to software engineering)
Economy of mechanism, fail-safe defaults, complete mediation, open design, separation of privileges, lease privilege, least common mechanism, psychological accountability, isolation, encapsulation, modularity, layering, least astonishment



--- Slide 17 ---
Fundamental security design principles [2/4]
Economy of mechanism: the design of security measures should be as simple as possible
Simpler to implement and to verify
Fewer vulnerabilities
Fail-safe default: access decisions should be based on permissions; i.e., the default is lack of access
Complete mediation: every access should checked against an access control system
Open design: the design should be open rather than secret (e.g., encryption algorithms) 



--- Slide 18 ---
Fundamental security design principles [3/4]
Isolation
Public access should be isolated from critical resources (no connection between public and critical information)
Users files should be isolated from one another (except when desired)
Security mechanism should be isolated (i.e., preventing access to those mechanisms)
Encapsulation: similar to object concepts (hide internal structures)
Modularity: modular structure




--- Slide 19 ---
Fundamental security design principles [4/4]
Layering (defense in depth): use of multiple, overlapping protection approaches
Least astonishment: a program or interface should always respond in a way that is least likely to astonish a user



--- Slide 20 ---
Fundamental security design principles
Separation of privilege: multiple privileges should be needed to do achieve access (or complete a task)
Least privilege: every user (process) should have the least privilege to perform a task
Least common mechanism: a design should minimize the function shared by different users (providing mutual security; reduce deadlock)
Psychological acceptability: security mechanisms should not interfere unduly with the work of users



--- Slide 21 ---
Attack surfaces
Attack surface: the reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system
Open ports
Services outside a firewall
An employee with access to sensitive info
…
Three categories
Network attack surface (i.e., network vulnerability)
Software attack surface (i.e., software vulnerabilities) 
Human attack surface (e.g., social engineering)
Attack analysis: assessing the scale and severity of threats


--- Slide 22 ---
Attack trees
A branching, hierarchical data structure that represents a set of potential vulnerabilities 
Objective: to effectively exploit the info available on attack patterns
published on CERT or similar forums
Security analysts can use the tree to guide design and strengthen coiuntermeasures 


--- Slide 23 ---
Computer security strategy
An overall strategy for providing security
Policy (specs): what security schemes are supposed to do
Assets and their values
Potential threats
Ease of use vs security
Cost of security vs cost of failure/recovery
Implementation/mechanism: how to enforce
Prevention
Detection
Response
Recovery
Correctness/assurance: does it really work (validation/review)
